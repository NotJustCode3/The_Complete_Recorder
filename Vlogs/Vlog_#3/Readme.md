### **2. Team's Progress:**

MJ - Introduce us!
Hello everyone. We are once again NotJustCode, and this is our final reflection of our recording app for the semester.

This project started as a passion project in my head. Through the help of my great friends, who are now also team members, they hopped on board with the same passion and zeal I had and we began to work. And so far, it has been an awesome learning experience, though it’s had its own set of challenges.

Zeezee - The goal of our application is to build a fully featured recording application with deep organizational features to help users keep their recordings organized, and find them quickly as well. 

After much discussion and research on how we would stand out from the competition in the same app category, we started sketching and designing our ideas. 

We had some issues as we had a lot of features we wanted to include in our app, but with time constraints, we didn’t really know how we could implement them all. We expressed this constraint during our team/instructor scrums, and how we can work to eliminate it. The feedback we received from Tim and our mentor, Yasser, was to highlight MVPs, so that we can work within our time constraints, and that’s exactly what we did.

Shafiq - We went through about 3 iterations before stumbling on a design we felt we were happy with. For our MVPs we knew we wanted to get the app to record, which is probably an important part of a recording app, add organizational features, and get the search functionality right, so we designed all possible interactions around search and folder organization. 

Azeezat - A very important thing to us was also organizing and keeping up with ourselves as a group. We knew that as students in our final year, there would be work load from other classes as well. 

So we set up a group for ourselves and consistent meeting times throughout the week to meet and talk through ideas together. We also created a project timeline for ourselves in addition to the semester’s timeline, so we can be sure we are keeping up with both our project timelines, as well as personal timelines.

MJ - we created sprints for each meeting we had towards our MVP and we kept our meeting logs and progress up to date on github. 

Few weeks out we were able to build our first lo-fi interactive prototype of our design to better visualize user interaction. 

We have had to listen to feedback and critique from some of our implementations and have had to go back to the designing phase to tweak so of those feedbacks and implement better features. 

Shafiq- After much prototyping we were ready to start building and developing. But it wasn't without it’s obstacles as well. We initially wanted to start off as an android platform as it was more accessible to us as a team working remotely, before moving over to ios.

But again with good critiques from our profs, we weren't aware of multi-platform solutions like xamarin, react native and flutter. 

After much research, we ended up going with flutter. And we had to go back to the drawing board as a team time together testing the new waters of a platform we were unprepared for.

MJ
As a team some of the challenges we’ve faced after deciding what platform we’ll use was, have flutter crashing and not working properly for a few of us and also making sure that we are able to collaborate with one another while developing together. Most of those issues have been ironed out, and we are moving forward. 

Azeezat - It’s been an exciting experience for us as we are already familiar with how we work together as a team, and what works for each of us individually. Also, we get to learn a new programming language, so that’s always a good thing! We have invested in the recommendation made by Tim about a flutter 2020 bootcamp on Udemy, and it is our current trajectory over the next month to complete the course, while porting concepts learned over to our project. And we are looking towards starting major MVP developments in January. 

And that’s it from us here at NotJustCode. Thank you all! And we wish you a

ALL
merry christmas and a happy new year
