### Opening scene

Video camera on MJ, playing his guitar and trying to record his song, as well as writing down the lyrics so he doesn’t forget them. He is annoyed and frustrated because it is taking a lot of time and he doesn’t have a good app to help him with his work.

Azeezat calls MJ, MJ puts the phone on speaker so the microphone can pick up on Azeezat’s voice too.

Azeezat: Hey MJ, what’s up?

MJ: I’m okay, just a bit frustrated, I’m trying to write some new songs and practice my guitar at the same time

Azeezat: Oh… is it because you can’t keep up with everything at once?

MJ: Yeah…

Azeezat: Well, have heard of the complete recorder?

MJ: what’s the complete recorder?

Cut to the complete recorder showcase

Azeezat: 
Let me introduce you to the complete recorder app.

The complete recorder is an application that allows you to organize y our recordings, and you can search for them in the list. 

Start SST
Best of all, “it can transcribe your recordings so you can stay focused on what matters”. 
Stop SST

So, what do you think MJ?

MJ: Wow, that’s really great, thanks Azeezat, that’s a huge weight off my chest. And I can even use it for other stuff too!
Azeezat: Happy to help! 

Azeezat, voiceover: “The complete recorder, letting you focus on what matters”
