### Team member (re)introductions: (Re)Introduce the team and (re)state roles and responsibilities (if they have changed or stayed the same)
Azeezat: Documentation, scrum, development
Shafiq: Design and Front End development
MJ: UI/UX development, design and development (Development Lead)
 
### Brief project blurb: Briefly restate what your team is doing, the business needs and/or the opportunity/innovation that your team's project idea will introduce into the world
Once again, we are NotJustCode and we are working on our Complete Recorder application. 
We decided to create the most fully featured recording application which is built on the foundation of deep search functionality and folder structure  integration.
Recording
Organizational features
The ability to search throughout the app.
A text to speech feature which transcribes the recording.
So we decided to build an app with all these functionalities, and we hope to add more later on.
 
Azeezat
### Scrum dates: State the start date and end date of this scrum
Our scrum started on January 11th and ended on January 30th, however, we have had to move some of the work items from the previous scrum to our current scrum, which is from February 1st to February 19th.
 
### Last Scrum Work items:
Complete Flutter course
Set up Github
Build different screens, kind of based on our lo fi prototypes we had at the very beginning, and giving them some functionalities
Start recording functionality of the application
Documentation, to track our work
Current Scrum Work items:
Complete recording functionality of the application
Begin the organizational functionalities
Documentation
 
### Status description: As a team, provide an overview of the project’s current status (green=good, yellow=slightly off track, red=off track). If the status is yellow or red, indicate:
The reason(s) that the status is yellow or red
As a team, we feel like our status is currently yellow. Like I mentioned, we weren’t able to finish what we had planned for the previous scrum, which was mainly to complete developing the recording functionality of the application.
Our setback was also due to one of our group members getting ill, however, the 2 remaining
The planned action(s) that will bring the project back to a green status.
We have done a lot of research on the different packages available for use in order to complete the recording functionality so we have been testing and researching to get it to work. 
 
Each member takes their part
### Team members must also individually speak to their contributions over the stated scrum dates. What did everyone do to contribute to where the project is at? NOTE: I want to hear (and hopefully see in the video) team members in the video (this is about professionalism here folks)
MJ: UI/UX development, design and development (Development Lead)
I try my best to direct everyone on what we need to accomplish, while also doing the same or different tasks on the side and Yea what shafiq said.
Shafiq: Design and Front End Development
Based on our UI design and illustration provided/assigned by MJ, I try to achieve as close as possible to what he as the UI developer/Dev. Lead in NotJustCode wants as the final product. Utilizing Flutter and Darts to create what our app pages are gonna look like.  All commits, results will be reviewed by  MJ and Azeezat for code quality, bugs fixing, etc. Currently working with both of my colleagues in figuring out which sound application packages work best for us.             
Azeezat: Documentation, scrum, development
I started the documentation, have been handling/putting together the scrums and planning, getting us up to date on what is due, and figuring out expectations. I have also been working on the development side of things.
 
To begin, our working technique was pair programming, and then branched off to try different ideas and packages to implement the different tasks we needed to complete
 
MJ
### Ensure to address any comments that came up in the previous scrum/meeting time
The comment we were given during our scrum was basically a challenge to have something ready for demo using the platform we are utilizing for our application, and we are ready to show off what we’ve got.
 
Project issues: List any issues from the Issue Log that are significant and should be shared with the audience of this report. If any related work has been done or decisions have been made, a summary should be provided.
Not applicable
 
Project changes: List any project changes that were approved since the last vlog, team/instructor scrum, or project bazaar day
Not applicable
 
### Project demo: Demo what ya got working as-is
Shooooooooooow off
 
Azeezat
### Next up: Discuss your team's plan for the next several weeks with respect to software design and development activities. Discuss the overall team plan but also (again), team members must individually speak to their contributions that are planned by the next meeting (regardless if it is a project bazaar day, vlog, or team/instructor scrum)
We are hoping to continue working on our recording functionality and making it better, as well as refactoring the code as it is a bit messy right now, from all the testing. Also, we want to get rid of redundancy and use functions/classes to make things cleaner. Our next MVP is to have the organizational functionalities completed. These are the folders and tags that we will be adding onto the recordings, we will see what works best given the platform we are using, as well as what we believe users will prefer. Then we want to have some user testing to see what they think so far.
 
Shafiq
### Team reflection
Discuss:
Does the team feel "on track"? (reiterate the above colour status)
Again, we feel like our status is currently yellow, just because we didn’t really complete the tasks we had set for ourselves to complete.
What progress does the team particularly feel good (great) about?
We feel really good about staying on track with completing the Flutter/Dart course. It really helped us with the best practices and easiest ways of working with Dart/Flutter
What barriers (if any) does the team feel is a current impediment to success?
Not really barriers, but there are so many different packages in Flutter and it’s very frustrating to try them all out to find out which works best to suit our needs. But we hope to have everything sorted soon.
What help, questions or concerns does the team have (if any)?
No questions or concerns as of now, but, we would like some feedback as to how we are doing so far.
