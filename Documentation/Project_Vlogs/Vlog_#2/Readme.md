**3. Team's Progress:**

  - Go over your team's progress, a historical, experiential, and reflective discussion of what your team has and is working on - from project initiating, planning,   executing, to closing (NOTE: your team is likely still in the project initiating and planning phases of your project (but maybe not??). To help guide your team's discussion it might be handy/useful to discuss your team's progress from the perspective of Deming's Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) model, discussing activities and knowledge generation that your team has and is experiencing with respect to progress towards the goal of achieving your team's "why" (solution) as a series of PDSAs.

**5. Next up - Discuss your team's plan for the next several weeks with respect to software design and development activities.:**

  - Next week - we will begin the tasks in the next sprint. We have done most of the prototyping so the next up for us will be getting feedback on our prototypes. And  then making the decisions for the coding language we want to use and research into tags and how to implement it into our app. And then we hope to begin implement mid November

  - Does the team feel "on track"?

  - What progress does the team particularly feel good (great) about?

  - What barriers (if any) does the team feel is a current impediment to success?

  - What help (if any) does the team require to move positively forward?

  - What questions or concerns does the team have (if any)?
