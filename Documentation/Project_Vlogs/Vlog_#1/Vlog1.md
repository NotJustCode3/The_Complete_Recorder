# Introduction Vlog - Vlog #1 :clapper:

**1. Vlogs (Part I):**

  - (i)    Unorganized recordings?

  - (ii)   Listening through each recording to find the right one?

  - (iii)  No way to search for the right recording?

**2. Vlogs (Part II) Introduction:**
  
  - Hi, my name is...
    
    - (i)   MJ
    
    - (ii)  Azeezat
    
    - (iii) Shafiq

  - And we are NotJustCode

**3. Reasons (MJ): (1:08:72mins)**

  - At NotJustCode, we decided to create the most fully featured recording application. We call it “The Complete recorder”.
    As an artist myself, I find that I usually tend to have about roughly 10 recordings per week; which in a span of a few weeks 
    can be quite a lot. In a week i could have:
    
     - (i)    5 song ideas
   
     - (ii)   3 Recording of sermons in church
   
     - (iii)  10 Choir rehearsal recordings
   
     - (iv)   School lectures and lots more…

  - I quickly discovered that one of the biggest things that bugged me was that I couldn’t quite find the perfect recording app to fit 
    my needs. I needed an app that would allow me:

   - (i)    Organize my recordings, rather than just piling them onto a list that I would later have to
            play back to find the right one.

   - (ii)   Allow me search for recordings I previously saved.

   - (iii)  And lastly that would allow me to get into a recording folder i created and make a recording within that folder where it can 
            be saved and searched for at a later time

  - After a while of searching the app store, all the applications i came across just never quite reached the functionality i was looking for.
    So we decided to build one, that can accomplish all this and lots more.

**4. Impact (Shaf man): (42:94 secs)**

  - This app will impact the world in the sense that it will be an app used by any and everyone for all recording needs. 
    Having the ability to organize the recordings is also a very important part of what we are trying to achieve or present.
    
  - It is a big problem or headache trying to sort through a list of recordings, especially when you might be creating a new one,
    probably up to 50 or even a 100 recordings a week. So of course, being able to categorize them is a big deal, 
    as we haven’t found any similar app out there in the market which meets these requirements.

  - The idea is that when we are done, everyone will have all their recording needs in one place.
  
**5. Audience (Zeezee): (1:05:71mins)**

  - Our audience is everyone who has a smartphone and uses their recording app in their day to day activities. 
    This could be someone wanting to take voice notes during their classes, record music, or even create a grocery list. 
    These people will all find our application to be of great use due to the many features we have in the works we can’t find in the 
    apps currently in the market. We plan to have:

    - (i)   Folders for different recordings, for example, a person could have their grocery list folder, a school folder, 
            a music folder, and so on

    - (ii)  The ability to search for any recording within a specific folder or throughout the app

    - (iii) Speeding up or slowing down a recording when playing it back

    - (iv)  The option to add more content to a pre-existing recording instead of creating a new one with the same subject matter

    - (v)   Being able to cut out or edit parts of the recordings

    - (vi)  A text to speech feature which transcribes the recording

**6.  What (ZeeZee):  (1:04:39 mins)**

  - Some constraints we envision coming across while building our application are:
  
    - Time & feature constraint: 
      - We may not be able to make the application fully featured at launch, given the time and other technological constraints that we may not 
        have the capacity to implement early on. We hope to start out with a few of these key features, and slowly add-on to it over time to
        create our vision of a one-stop recorder that can do it all.
        
    - UI Constraints: 
      - We hope to find a perfect balance between features we know users would love and also something that is easy and simple to understand;
        we don’t want to create an app that requires a lot of explanation.

    - Programming language constraint:
      - We would love for our application to be cross-platform, but we may end up having to start on one platform that is more easily 
        accessible to us a team to build on, before branching out to the others.
