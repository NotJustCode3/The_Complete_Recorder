   - (i)    Unorganized recordings?

   - (ii)   Listening through each recording to find the right one?

   - (iii)  No way to search for the right recording?

**2. Vlogs (Part II) Introduction:**
Hi, my name is...
● MJ
● Azeezat
● Shafiq
And we are NotJustCode
Reasons (MJ): (1:08:72mins)
At NotJustCode, we decided to create the most fully featured recording application.
We call it “The Complete recorder”.
As an artist myself, I find that I usually tend to have about roughly 10 recordings per week;
which in a span of a few weeks can be quite a lot.
In a week i could have:
● 5 song ideas
● 3 Recording of sermons in church
● 10 Choir rehearsal recordings
● School lectures and lots more…
I quickly discovered that one of the biggest things that bugged me was that I couldn’t quite find
the perfect recording app to fit my needs. I needed an app that would allow me:
● Organize my recordings, rather than just piling them onto a list that I would later have to
play back to find the right one.
● Allow me search for recordings I previously saved.
● And lastly that would allow me to get into a recording folder i created and make a
recording within that folder where it can be saved and searched for at a later time
After a while of searching the app store, all the applications i came across just never quite
reached the functionality i was looking for. So we decided to build one, that can accomplish all
this and lots more.
Impact (Shaf man): (42:94 secs)
This app will impact the world in the sense that it will be an app used by any and
everyone for all recording needs. Having the ability to organize the recordings is also a very
important part of what we are trying to achieve or present. It is a big problem or headache trying
to sort through a list of recordings, especially when you might be creating a new one, probably
up to 50 or even a 100 recordings a week. So of course, being able to categorize them is a big
deal, as we haven’t found any similar app out there in the market which meets these
requirements.
The idea is that when we are done, everyone will have all their recording needs in one place.
