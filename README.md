This app is something which one of our group members has been looking for but seems not to currently be in the market. Most sound recorders 
pile up recording into a list, without basic search functionality and organization to help users find a specific recording. As a user that records 
about 12 recordings a week, sifting through a pile of recordings and playing each one of them just to find the one recording you're looking for can be a pain.
