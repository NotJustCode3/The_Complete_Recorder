# The Complete Recorder :studio_microphone:
A sound recording app with organizational features for easy access and search.

## Background :heavy_plus_sign: - [Wiki](https://github.com/NotJustCode3/The_Complete_Recorder/wiki) for more.
This app is something which one of our group members has been looking for but seems not to currently be in the market. Most sound recorders 
pile up recording into a list, without basic search functionality and organization to help users find a specific recording. As a user that records 
about 12 recordings a week, sifting through a pile of recordings and playing each one of them just to find the one recording you're looking for can be a pain.
